# asx_announcements
Web scrape of daily ASX announcements, emailed to list of friends

My friends and I wanted to see the announcements listed on on the ASX every morning before the market opened. 
I found a list of announcements on the ASX website, so hacked this scraper together. 
It combines the annoucements and price information together in a csv file, and then emails it to a list of email addresses

Anonymised code uploaded, along with a sample output.
